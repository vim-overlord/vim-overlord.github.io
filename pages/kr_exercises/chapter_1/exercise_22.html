          Write a program to “fold” long input lines into two or more shorter
          lines after the last non-blank character that occurs before the
          <var>n</var>-th column of input. Make sure your program does
          something intelligent with very long lines, and if there are no
          blanks or tabs before the specified column.

      <p>
        Our first instinct might be to create a variable that keeps track of
        which column we are on, and print a newline if it exceeds a certain
        constant.
      </p>

      <pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    #define MAXLEN 80   /* column limit for output lines */
    #define TABWIDTH 4  /* indent size */
    
    main()
    {
        int c, i;
        int col;    /* current column */
    
        col = 0;
        while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
            if (col &gt; MAXLEN) {
                putchar('\n');
                col = 0;
            }
            putchar(c);
            ++col;
            if (c == '\t')
                col = col + (TABWIDTH - col % TABWIDTH);
            else if (c == '\n')
                col = 0;
        }
        return 0;
    }</code></pre>

      <samp>
        However, this approach does not work as intended as it also places line
        breaks in be<br />
        tween words.
      </samp>
      <p>
        In order for our program to function correctly, it needs to be able to
        recognize words. A technique that comes in handy when developing
        programs of higher complexity is to write the steps of a program in
        pseudocode. Let us try doing that with our program.
      </p>

      <pre><code>    while (character is not end-of-file indicator)
        read in text until whitespace or until equal to column limit
        if (printing the text passes column limit)
            move to next line
        print text
        while (next character is blank or tab and column limit has not been passed)
            read in and print character
        if (column limit has been passed)
            read in remaining whitespace
            move to next line</code></pre>

      <p>
        It may be a bit unclear as to how we want our program to work, so let
        us look at a few examples. For now, assume that the column limit is
        ten.
      </p>

      <pre>    <samp>&gt; <kbd>hello, world</kbd>
    
    hello, 
    world</samp></pre>

      <p>
        We first read in <kbd>hello,</kbd> and check if printing it means
        crossing the column limit. This is not the case, so we just print the
        text. Next, we print the space. Finally, we read in <kbd>world</kbd>.
        If we were to print it out, we would pass the column limit, so we move
        to the next line before printing <kbd>world</kbd>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us see how we will deal with words longer than the column limit.
      </p>

      <pre>    <samp>&gt; <kbd>abcdefghijklm nopqrstuvwxyz</kbd>
    
    abcdefghij 
    klm 
    nopqrstuvw 
    xyz</samp></pre>

      <p>
        To begin, we only read in <kbd>abcdefghijk</kbd>, because at that
        point, the length of the text is equal to the column limit. Printing it
        out does not mean we pass the column limit, so we just print the
        string. The next character is not a whitespace, so the entire bottom
        half of the loop gets skipped. Then, we read in <kbd>klm</kbd>.
        Printing it out would mean crossing the column limit, so we move to the
        next line and then print it. We then print out the whitespace. Next, we
        read in <kbd>nopqrstuvw</kbd>. Printing it would cross the column
        limit, so like before, we move to the next line prior to printing it
        out. There is no whitespace afterward so the next part gets skipped.
        Finally, we read in <kbd>xyz</kbd>. Once again, printing it would mean
        passing the column limit, so we move to the next line first.
      </p>
      <p>What about when we have long sequences of whitespace?</p>

      <pre>    <samp>&gt; <kbd>Lorem                    \
    ipsum                    dolor</kbd>

    Lorem     
    ipsum     
    dolor</samp></pre>

      <p>
        First, we read in and print <kbd>Lorem</kbd>. Then we keep reading in
        and printing the spaces until we pass the column limit, at which point
        we exit the loop. Then, we skip past the remaining whitespace. Next, we
        read in <kbd>ipsum</kbd>. Printing it would mean crossing the column
        limit, so we print a newline first. We then read in as much of the
        whitespace as we can, and then skip past the rest. Like before,
        printing <kbd>dolor</kbd> would mean passing the column limit, so we
        move to the next line first. Notice how all the examples so far leave
        trailing whitespace. We could try and avoid this, but that would only
        complicate things since we would need to read one word ahead in order
        to know if the whitespace will be trailing. Plus, we have already
        written a program that deals with that situation!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that we have the steps down, we need to convert our pseudocode into
        actual code. We start with the following template.
      </p>

      <pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    #define MAXLEN 80   /* column limit for output lines */
    #define TABWIDTH 4  /* indent size */
    
    main()
    {
        while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
            /* code */;
        return 0;
    }</code></pre>

      <p>
        In order to read in a word, we create the character array
        <var>word</var> to store all the characters we read in up until a
        whitespace character, or if the string's length exceeds
        <code>MAXLEN</code>. We can also create the integer variable
        <var>len</var> to store a word's length, which increments for every
        character read in. Finally, we must also not forget to null-terminate
        our string after it is finished being read into!
      </p>

      <pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    #define MAXLEN 80   /* column limit for output lines */
    #define TABWIDTH 4  /* indent size */
    
    main()
    {
        <ins>int c;</ins>
        <ins>char word[MAXLEN + 1];  /* current word */</ins>
        <ins>int len;                /* current word length */</ins>
    
        while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
            <ins>for (len = 0; c != ' ' && c != '\t' && c != '\n' && len &lt; MAXLEN;</ins>
                <ins>++len) {</ins>
                <ins>word[len] = c;</ins>
                <ins>c = getchar();</ins>
            <ins>}</ins>
            <ins>word[len] = '\0';</ins>
        }
        return 0;
    }</code></pre>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> it is good practice to keep lines of your code shorter
        than a certain character limit to keep it readable on smaller displays
        (eighty characters is generally a good benchmark.) Remember, unlike
        some other languages, C is not particularly strict about whitespace and
        many constructs can span over multiple lines. After we finish writing
        this program, you can have it do this for you!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> the size of <var>word</var> is <code>MAXLEN + 1</code>
        in order to allocate space for the additional null character.
      </p>
      <p>
        Printing the word is fairly straightforward: we use
        <code>printf</code> and the <code>%s</code> format specifier. We will
        also need to create the integer variable <var>col</var> to keep track
        of our column by incrementing it by <var>len</var> for every word.
        Before printing a word, if <code>col + len</code> is greater than
        <code>MAXLEN</code>, we will need to print a newline and reset
        <var>col</var> to zero.
      </p>

      <pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    #define MAXLEN 80   /* column limit for output lines */
    #define TABWIDTH 4  /* indent size */
    
    main()
    {
        int c;
        <ins>int col;                /* current column */</ins>
        char word[MAXLEN + 1];  /* current word */
        int len;                /* current word length */
    
        <ins>col = 0;</ins>
        while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
            for (len = 0; c != ' ' && c != '\t' && c != '\n' && len &lt; MAXLEN;
                ++len) {
                word[len] = c;
                c = getchar();
            }
            word[len] = '\0';
            <ins>if (col + len &gt; MAXLEN) {</ins>
                <ins>putchar('\n');</ins>
                <ins>col = 0;</ins>
            <ins>}</ins>
            <ins>printf("%s", word);</ins>
            <ins>col = col + len;</ins>
        }
        return 0;
    }</code></pre>

      <p>
        After the word is printed, we need to deal with the whitespace that
        comes after it. We want our program to be able to deal with sequences
        of whitespace, so we use a loop that continues to run as long as the
        next character is a blank or tab and <var>col</var> is less than or
        equal to the column limit. During every iteration, we print the
        whitespace character, increment <var>col</var> by the corresponding
        amount, and read in the next character.
      </p>

      <pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    #define MAXLEN 80   /* column limit for output lines */
    #define TABWIDTH 4  /* indent size */
    
    main()
    {
        int c;
        int col;                /* current column */
        char word[MAXLEN + 1];  /* current word */
        int len;                /* current word length */
    
        col = 0;
        while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
            for (len = 0; c != ' ' && c != '\t' && c != '\n' && len &lt; MAXLEN;
                ++len) {
                word[len] = c;
                c = getchar();
            }
            word[len] = '\0';
            if (col + len &gt; MAXLEN) {
                putchar('\n');
                col = 0;
            }
            printf("%s", word);
            col = col + len;
            <ins>for (len = 0; (c == ' ' || c == '\t') && col &lt;= MAXLEN; ++len) {</ins>
                <ins>if (c == ' ')</ins>
                    <ins>++col;</ins>
                <ins>else if (c == '\t')</ins>
                    <ins>col = col + (TABWIDTH - col % TABWIDTH);</ins>
                <ins>putchar(c);</ins>
                <ins>c = getchar();</ins>
            <ins>}</ins>
        }
        return 0;
    }</code></pre>

      Finally,

      <pre><code>    if (column limit has been passed)
        read in remaining whitespace
        move to next line</code></pre>

      directly translates to

      <pre><code>    if (col > MAXLEN) {
        while (c == ' ' || c == '\t')
            c = getchar();
        putchar('\n');
        col = 0;
    }</code></pre>

      so we can add that to our program.

      <pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    #define MAXLEN 80   /* column limit for output lines */
    #define TABWIDTH 4  /* indent size */
    
    main()
    {
        int c;
        int col;                /* current column */
        char word[MAXLEN + 1];  /* current word */
        int len;                /* current word length */
    
        col = 0;
        while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
            for (len = 0; c != ' ' && c != '\t' && c != '\n' && len &lt; MAXLEN;
                ++len) {
                word[len] = c;
                c = getchar();
            }
            word[len] = '\0';
            if (col + len &gt; MAXLEN) {
                putchar('\n');
                col = 0;
            }
            printf("%s", word);
            col = col + len;
            for (len = 0; (c == ' ' || c == '\t') && col &lt;= MAXLEN; ++len) {
                if (c == ' ')
                    ++col;
                else if (c == '\t')
                    col = col + (TABWIDTH - col % TABWIDTH);
                putchar(c);
                c = getchar();
            }
            <ins>if (col &gt; MAXLEN) {</ins>
                <ins>/* read in remaining whitespace if column limit is reached */</ins>
                <ins>while (c == ' ' || c == '\t')</ins>
                    <ins>c = getchar();</ins>
                <ins>putchar('\n');</ins>
                <ins>col = 0;</ins>
            <ins>}</ins>
        }
        return 0;
    }</code></pre>

      <p>
        Let's test our program with the test cases at the start of this page.
        For now, we can change <code>MAXLEN</code> to ten. If we enter
        <kbd>hello, world</kbd>, the output we get is
      </p>

      <pre><samp>    hello, 
    orld</samp></pre>

      <p>
        with no newline after <samp>d</samp>. That does not match with what we
        want. Let us try to trace the issue. First, our program reads in
        <kbd>hello,</kbd>, and then prints it out. At this point,
        <var>c</var> is equal to a space. Then, we print the space and
        <code>'<kbd>w</kbd>'</code> is assigned to <var>c</var>. Now, we see
        where the first problem is: we run <code>getchar</code> again at the
        start of the next iteration. To fix this, we need to remove the
        function call in the <code>while</code>-loop, and instead call
        <code>getchar</code> at the start of the program to get it running.
      </p>

      <pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    #define MAXLEN 10   /* column limit for output lines */
    #define TABWIDTH 4  /* indent size */
    
    main()
    {
        int c;
        int col;                /* current column */
        char word[MAXLEN + 1];  /* current word */
        int len;                /* current word length */
    
        col = 0;
        <ins>c = getchar();</ins>
        <del>while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {</del>
        <ins>while (c != EOF) {</ins>
        ...
    }</code></pre>

      Now, the output we get is

      <pre><samp>    hello,</samp>
    (waiting for input)</pre>

      <p>
        Now <kbd>world</kbd> does not get printed at all. Let us continue
        tracing our program from before. After <kbd>world</kbd> is read in, the
        next character is a newline and it is what gets carried over to the
        next iteration. This is not what we want. We want to print the newline,
        and have the next character—<code>EOF</code> in this case—carry over to
        the next iteration. Now we see why the input does not terminate: it
        never receives the <code>EOF</code>. We can solve this by also running
        the code inside the last <code>if</code>-statement when we come across
        a newline, in addition to reading in the next character. Using the same
        <code>if</code>-statement also means input with trailing whitespace
        will also cause no issues since the <code>while</code>-loop will skip
        past it.
      </p>

                <ins>if (c == '\n')</ins>
