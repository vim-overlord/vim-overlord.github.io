        In Appendix B, there are two charts that list all the constants defined
        in <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;float.h&gt;</code>.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/limits.jpeg"
        alt="Constants defined in &lt;limits.h&gt;"
        style="width: 33%; float: left"
      /><br />
      <img
        src="/images/float_limits.jpeg"
        alt="Constants defined in &lt;float.h&gt;"
        style="width: 33%; margin-left: 10px"
      />
      <p>
        We can include the two header files and print the value of the
        constants we need to know.
      </p>

      <pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;limits.h&gt;
    #include &lt;float.h&gt;
    
    main()
    {
        printf("signed char: %d to %d\n", SCHAR_MIN, SCHAR_MAX);
        printf("unsigned char: 0 to %d\n", UCHAR_MAX);
        printf("signed int: %d to %d\n", INT_MIN, INT_MAX);
        printf("unsigned int: 0 to %u\n", UINT_MAX);
        printf("signed short: %d to %d\n", SHRT_MIN, SHRT_MAX);
        printf("unsigned short: 0 to %d\n", USHRT_MAX);
        printf("signed long: %ld to %ld\n", LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX);
        printf("unsigned long: 0 to %lu\n", ULONG_MAX);
        printf("float: %g to %g\n", FLT_MIN, FLT_MAX);
        printf("double: %g to %g\n", DBL_MIN, DBL_MAX);
    }</code></pre>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> these constants are implementation-defined and considering
        this book was written when 32-bit machines prevailed, you will likely
        find that some of the limits differ from what is listed in the charts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> in the code above, we also see some new format specifiers:
        <code>%u</code>, <code>%ld</code>, <code>%lu</code>, and
        <code>%g</code>. The first is used for <code>unsigned</code> integers
        and the specifiers with <code>l</code> correspond to the long types.
        Perhaps the most interesting of these is <code>%g</code>; it works with
        both <code>float</code> and <code>double</code> literals and displays
        them in scientific notation. See
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_data_types#Main_types"
          >this page</a
        >
        for the full list of valid format specifiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> the limits for the floating-point minimums
        (<code>FLT_MIN</code> and <code>DBL_MIN</code>) are not set to the
        actual minimum value of the type, but rather the smallest positive
        normalized value (we will look into what that word means soon.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us now look at how we can compute the limits. This exercise
        alongside many to come leave lots of room for interpretation. What does
        it mean to compute a limit? Here, we look at two ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first method revolves around the idea that after a variable reaches
        its limit, attempting to increment its value would result in the
        incorrect value. We create a <var>temp</var> variable alongside two
        other variables to store the minimum and maximum values. In order to
        calculate the maximum value, we set <var>temp</var> to one and
        <var>max</var> to zero to start. We then enter a <code>for</code>-loop
        that increments both values every iteration and runs as long as
        <var>temp</var> is one more than <var>max</var> (i.e. as long as the
        behavior is as expected). We do the same thing to calculate
        <var>min</var>, except <var>temp</var> will always be one less and both
        values will decrement every iteration instead.
      </p>

      <pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    main()
    {
        signed char min, max, temp;
        unsigned char umax;
    
        min = max = 0;
        for (temp = -1; temp == min - 1; --temp)
            --min;
        for (temp = 1; temp == max + 1; ++temp)
            ++max;
        for (temp = 1; temp == umax + 1; ++temp)
            ++umax;
        printf("signed char: %d to %d\n", min, max);
        printf("unsigned char: 0 to %d\n", umax);
        /* the rest of the limits are computed the same way */
    }</code></pre>

      <p>
        Although all the limits are implementation-defined, most
        implementations will have <code>signed char</code>s ranging from -128
        to 127 and <code>unsigned char</code>s ranging from 0 to 255. This is
        because a <code>char</code> usually takes up a byte, or eight bits in
        memory. 1111 1111<sub>binary</sub> translates to 255, the maximum value
        of an <code>unsigned char</code>. As for <code>signed char</code>s, in
        a two's complement machine (which is most machines these days), the
        leftmost bit has the place value -128 in order to also allow negative
        values. Thus, 1000 0000 (-128<sub>10</sub>) and 0111 1111
        (127<sub>10</sub>) correspond to the limits of a
        <code>signed char</code>. Perhaps we can use this information to find
        another way to calculate the limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The method we had previously used works, but it would take an
        unfathomably long time to calculate the limits of longer types, such as
        <code>unsigned long</code>. Knowing that values are stored as bits
        under the hood, a more informed approach would be to multiply by two
        every iteration instead. We can employ a similar tactic from before
        where we create two variables, multiply one first, and assign its value
        to the other as long as it is still within the range. This continues
        until the variable goes out of the range. If <var>max</var> and
        <var>temp</var> are <code>unsigned char</code>s, by the end,
        <var>max</var> will be equal to 128, or 1000 0000<sub>binary</sub>. The
        negative of <var>max</var> is the minimum value for a
        <code>signed char</code>, one less is the maximum value, and
        <code>max + (max - 1)</code> (i.e. 1000 0000<sub>binary</sub> + 0111
        1111<sub>binary</sub>) is the maximum value for an
        <code>unsigned char</code>. The same logic applies to the other types.
      </p>

      <pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    main()
    {
        unsigned char max, temp;
    
        temp = 2;
        for (max = 1; max == temp / 2; temp = temp * 2)
            max = c;
        printf("signed char: %d to %d\n", -max, max - 1);
        max = max + (max - 1);
        printf("unsigned char: 0 to %d\n", max);
        /* the rest of the limits are computed the same way */
    }</code></pre>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> we check if <code>max == temp / 2</code> instead of
        <code>temp == max * 2</code> because when <var>max</var> reaches the
        maximum value, multiplying it by two would give us the wrong value.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> we write <code>max + (max - 1)</code> instead of
        <code>max * 2 - 1</code> because the value of <code>max * 2</code>
        exceeds the maximum value for a <code>unsigned char</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might have realized that the approach we have used here does not
        work with the floating-point types. This is because they are stored in
        a different way. To be able to calculate their limits, we first need to
        take a look at how floating-point numbers work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Floating-point is analogous to scientific notation, but it uses binary
        instead. Almost all implementations of floating-point numbers use the
        standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a>,
        which states that the bits allocated to a floating-point number are
        split into three parts: the sign bit, the exponent, and the fraction.
        The sign bit comes first and it determines if the number is positive or
        negative. The exponent is the power of two the number is multiplied by,
        similar to how numbers are multiplied by powers of ten in scientific
        notation. In a 32-bit floating-point number, eight bits are allocated
        to the exponent, so its value is shifted by -127 in order to also allow
        negative exponents. This means 1000 0000 represents one, not 128.
        Finally, the fraction is the part that contains the digits of the
        number using binary place values (e.g. 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc.) In
        scientific notation, the first digit of the fraction must be nonzero,
        and in binary, there is only one nonzero digit: one, so it is implied
        and not included in the bits for the fraction. Here are a few examples
        of the bit representations for various floating-point values.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Floating-point (32-bit)</th>
          <th>Translation</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>0 10000000 01000000000000000000000</td>
          <td>1.25 * 2<sup>1</sup></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1 10000010 10000000000000000000000</td>
          <td>-1.5 * 2<sup>3</sup></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>0 01111101 11000000000000000000000</td>
          <td>1.75 * 2<sup>-2</sup></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Floating-point values tend to be inaccurate. For example,
        0.1 is stored as 0.100000001490116119384765625 because a tenth in
        binary is 0.1001... and there are not an infinite number of bits to
        store the value. To account for this, past a certain threshold the
        number gets rounded.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-off_error">This page</a>
        has more details about rounding errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> When the exponent is set to all zeros (equivalent to -127
        in a 32-bit floating-point number), the number becomes denormalized.
        This means that the leading one for the fraction is no longer implied.
        This allows for very small values to be stored at the expense of
        accuracy. As mentioned previously, the constants <code>FLT_MIN</code>
        and <code>DBL_MIN</code> are equal to the smallest
        <strong>normalized</strong> values, and that is what we will be
        calculating for as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this in mind, the largest normalized value for a
        <code>float</code> is the fraction 2.0 times the largest exponent, and
        the smallest normalized value is the fraction 1.0 divided by one less
        than the largest exponent. We can calculate the exponent in the same
        way we calculated the limits for the integer types.
      </p>

      <pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    main()
    {
        float exponent, temp;
    
        temp = 2.0;
        for (exponent = 1.0; exponent == temp / 2.0; temp = temp * 2.0)
            exponent = f;
        printf("float: %g to %g\n", 1.0 / (exponent / 2.0), 2.0 * exponent);
    }</code></pre>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> in case it was unclear, multiplying <var>exponent</var>
        by two is the equivalent of doubling the exponent part of its bit
        representation whilst leaving the fraction part as 1.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> In order for this to work with <code>double</code>, for
        the maximum, we multiply <var>exponent</var> by 1.999999999999999
        instead of 2.0 in order to avoid the number rounding to Infinity.
        Calculating floating-point limits is extremely finicky and so
        1.999999999999999 may not work on all implementations. You can play
        around with this yourself to find out at what value the number rounds
        up for you. If you ever need to use the limits in one of your programs
        (especially for a floating-point value), there is a reason why
        pre-defined constants exist!
