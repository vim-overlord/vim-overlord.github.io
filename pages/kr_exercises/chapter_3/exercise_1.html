          Our binary search makes two tests inside the loop, when one would
          suffice (at the price of more tests outside). Write a version with
          only one test inside the loop and measure the difference in run-time.

      <p>
        There are three scenarios for when we check a number: it is greater
        than <code>v[mid]</code>, less than <code>v[mid]</code>, or equal to
        <code>v[mid]</code>. Currently, we have tests for each scenario, but we
        can combine the latter two. Now, if the number is greater than
        <code>v[mid]</code>, we update <var>low</var> to <code>mid-1</code>,
        but in both other cases, we update <var>high</var> to <var>mid</var>.
        We also update the condition of the <code>while</code>-loop to
        <code>low &lt; high</code> because now <var>low</var> and
        <var>high</var> could be equal if the number is found. Once we exit the
        loop, we check if <code>v[low]</code> is equal to <var>x</var>; if it
        is, we return <var>low</var>, but otherwise, we return -1.
      </p>

      <pre><code>    /* binsearch:  find x in v[0] <= v[1] <= ... <= v[n-1] */
    int binsearch(int x, int v[], int n)
    {
        int low, high, mid;
    
        low = 0;
        high = n - 1;
        <del>while (low &lt;= high) {</del>
        <ins>while (low &lt; high) {</ins>
            mid = (low+high) / 2;
            <del>if (x &lt; v[mid])</del>
                <del>high = mid - 1;</del>
            <del>else if (x &gt; v[mid])</del>
                <del>low = mid + 1;</del>
            <del>else    /* found match */</del>
                <del>return mid;</del>
            <ins>if (x &lt;= v[mid])</ins>
                <ins>high = mid;</ins>
            <ins>else</ins>
                <ins>low = mid + 1;</ins>
        }
        <del>return -1;  /* no match */</del>
        <ins>return (v[low] == x) ? low : -1;</ins>
    }</code></pre>

      <p>
        After timing both versions on various tests, suprisingly, the initial
        version was on average 6% faster! This is because in our version, when
        <var>x</var> is found, we do not always immediately return unlike the
        original version. This may be a scenario where the book shows its age.
        Back in the day, computers were much slower than they are today and
        perhaps minimizing checks would have outweighed the downside of
        requiring more iterations on certain inputs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> if you want to time the program yourself, you can use the
        <code>time</code> command found on various *nix systems. Better yet,
        try combining it with the <code>for</code>-loop in your shell (e.g.
        <kbd>for i in {1..10}; do time ./execname; done</kbd> in
        <code>bash</code> times the program 10 times) to test it multiple times
        so you can find the average time.
