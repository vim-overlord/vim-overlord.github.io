        Often touted as the greatest programming book of all time,
        <cite>The C Programming Language</cite> by Brian Kernighan and Dennis
        Ritchie was my first foray into programming. The book is legendary for
        its exercises, and whilst solving them, I recorded the thought process
        that led to my solutions. Any concepts used in my solutions would have
        been covered by that point in the book. Below are my notes for each
        exercise.
