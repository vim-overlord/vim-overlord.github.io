          Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax errors
          like unbalanced parentheses, brackets and braces. Don't forget about
          quotes, both single and double, escape sequences, and comments. (This
          program is hard if you do it in full generality.)

    <main>
      <p>
        Keeping in mind that a valid C program should have a closing sequence
        for every opening sequence (e.g. <code>{...}</code>,
        <code>"..."</code>, <code>/* ... */</code>, etc), we know that a valid
        program must have an equal number of opening and closing sequences.
        Therefore, every time we come across a <code>{</code>, for example, we
        increment the <var>braces</var> counter, and when we come across its
        closing sequence, <code>}</code>, we decrement the <var>braces</var>
        counter. We do this for each type of bracket. If the program is valid,
        all of these counters should be equal to zero in the end, and at no
        point should they be less than zero. For the two types of quotes, we
        use variables that switch between the constants <code>IN</code> and
        <code>OUT</code>. When the program stops reading input, these variables
        should be equal to <code>OUT</code> if the program is valid. We do a
        similar thing with comments, except for them we need to read two
        characters using nested <code>if</code>-statements. Finally, we also
        make sure to skip past escape sequences.
      </p>

      <pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    #define IN 1    /* inside a comment or string */
    #define OUT 0   /* outside a comment or string */

        int c;
        int parens, brackets, braces;   /* counter for unbalanced brackets */
        int character, string, comment; /* boolean values set to IN or OUT */
    
        parens = brackets = braces = 0;
        character = string = comment = OUT;
        while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
            if (c == '\\') {    /* skip escape sequences */

    }</code></pre>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> we check for comments first because if the program
        contained a slash followed by a character that is not an asterisk, or
        vice versa, the second character still needs to go through the series
        of <code>if</code>-statements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> notice how the <code>if</code>-statement that checks for a
        slash has braces after it. They are necessary because otherwise, the
        <code>else</code>-clause afterward would correspond to the nested
        <code>if</code>-statement instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as you might have realized already, this approach is rather
        inaccurate. For example, the input <kbd>{(})</kbd> is considered valid,
        but <kbd>'}'</kbd> is not. Let us go back to the drawing board and
        approach this problem in a different way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most intuitive solution to this exercise involves using recursion.
        While it has not yet been explicitly covered in the book, the idea is
        fairly easy to grasp. Recursion is what happens when you call a
        function within its own body. One might think this would cause the
        compiler to throw an error, but instead, the program will enter an
        infinite loop. In order to avoid this, the function call needs to be
        wrapped in an <code>if</code>-statement, so that when the condition is
        no longer true, the loop breaks. To illustrate this, the code
      </p>

      <pre><code>    int i;
    
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i)
        printf("%d\n", i);</code></pre>

      would be written as follows when using a recursive approach:

      <pre><code>    void recursive(int i)
    {
        if (i &lt; 3) {
            ++i;
            printf("%d\n", i);
            recursive(i);
        }
    }
    
    recursive(0);</code></pre>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> the order of the statements in recursion is of utmost
        importance. For example, if <code>++i</code> came after the
        <code>recursive</code> function call, it would never be reached.
      </p>
      <p>
        What if we moved the <code>recursive</code> call before the
        <code>printf</code> call?
      </p>

      <pre><code>    void recursive(int i)
    {
        if (i &lt; 3) {
            ++i;
            recursive(i);
            printf("%d\n", i);
        }
    }
    
    recursive(0);</code></pre>

      Then, we get the output

      <pre><samp>    3
    2
    1</samp></pre>

      <p>
        because <code>recursive</code> calls itself until <var>i</var> is equal
        to three, at which point it executes the <code>printf</code> statement.
        Afterward, the program goes back to the second call of
        <code>recursive</code> (when <var>i</var> was equal to two) and prints
        <var>i</var>, and then the program goes to the first call of
        <code>recursive</code> (when <var>i</var> was equal to one) and prints
        <var>i</var>. In essence, it runs as follows, except whenever
        <var>i</var> increments, it only applies to that instance of the
        function call:
      </p>

      <pre><code>    void recursive(int i)
    {
        if (i &lt; 3) {
            ++i;
            if (i &lt; 3) {
                ++i;
                if (i &lt; 3) {
                    ++i;
                    if (i &lt; 3) {    /* the condition is not met */
                        ++i;
                        recursive(i);
                        printf("%d\n", i);
                    }
                    printf("%d\n", i);
                }
                /* go back to second call of recursive */
                printf("%d\n", i);
            }
            /* go back to first call of recursive */
            printf("%d\n", i);
        }
    }
    
    recursive(0);</code></pre>

      <p>
        Let us get back to the problem at hand. The first thing we do is create
        a function called <code>read_block</code>, which reads in a code block
        until its closing character or <code>EOF</code> is reached and returns
        the symbolic constant <code>YES</code> if the block is valid. If we
        disregard strings and comments for now, a block is valid if it meets
        three requirements:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Its closing sequence is found</li>
        <li>There are no extra closing brackets</li>
        <li>All the blocks within it are also valid</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The first two requirements are easy to implement:</p>

      <pre><code>    #define YES 1
    #define NO 0
    
    /* read_block:  reads a block until its closing sequence or EOF is reached;
        returns YES block is valid, NO if block is invalid */
    int read_block(int end)
    {
        int c;
    
        while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
            if (c == end)
                return YES;
            /* check for closing braces without a corresponding opening brace */
            else if (c == ')' || c == ']' || c == '}')
                return NO;
        }
        return NO;
    }</code></pre>

      <p>
        The first block we read in will have the closing sequence
        <code>EOF</code>; in other words, it is the entire program. Then, every
        time we come across an opening bracket, we call <code>read_block</code>
        recursively and assign its return value to a variable called
        <var>valid</var>, which keeps track of whether the current block is
        valid. Whenever a block is no longer valid, we exit the
        <code>while</code>-loop and return <code>NO</code>. This way, if any
        instance of <code>read_block</code> ever returns <code>NO</code>, all
        its parent blocks are rendered invalid too.
      </p>

      <pre><code>    <ins>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</ins>
    
    #define YES 1
    #define NO 0
    
    <ins>int read_block(int end);</ins>
    
    <ins>main()</ins>
    <ins>{</ins>
        <ins>int valid;  /* whether the C program is valid or not */</ins>
    
        <ins>if ((valid = read_block(EOF)) == NO)</ins>
            <ins>printf("syntax error!\n");</ins>
        <ins>printf("syntax error!\n");</ins>
    <ins>}</ins>
    
    /* read_block:  reads a block until its closing sequence or EOF is reached;
        returns YES block is valid, NO if block is invalid */
    int read_block(int end)
    {
        int c;
        <ins>int valid;  /* whether current block is valid */</ins>
    
        <ins>valid = YES;</ins>
        while ((c = getchar()) != EOF<ins> && valid == YES</ins>) {
            if (c == end)
                return YES;
            /* check for closing braces without a corresponding opening brace */
            else if (c == ')' || c == ']' || c == '}')
                return NO;
            <ins>else if (c == '(')</ins>
                <ins>valid = read_block(')');</ins>
            <ins>else if (c == '[')</ins>
                <ins>valid = read_block(']');</ins>
            <ins>else if (c == '{')</ins>
                <ins>valid = read_block('}');</ins>
        }
        <ins>if (c != EOF)</ins>
            return NO;
        <ins>else</ins>
            <ins>return valid;</ins>
    }</code></pre>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> we normally exit the <code>while</code>-loop when a block
        is not valid. The one exception is the caller in <code>main</code>,
        which will also exit the loop when the entire program is finished being
        read. This is the reason for the <code>if</code>-statement at the
        bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the hard work has now been done and adding support for strings
        and comments is relatively easy. We create the two functions
        <code>read_cmt</code> and <code>read_str</code> which when called read
        in all the characters up until their closing sequences. In the case of
        <code>read_str</code>, we also pass in the kind of quote as an argument
        and make sure to ignore escape sequences. Both functions return
        <code>YES</code> if their closing sequence is found, and
        <code>NO</code> if they read in an <code>EOF</code>. Similar to the
        brackets, the functions get called when their opening sequences are
        found in <code>read_block</code>, and their return value is assigned to
        <var>valid</var>.
